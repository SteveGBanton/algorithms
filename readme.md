## Algorithm Work

A repo for complex algo work!

Plan to implement DNA/Protein manipulation, machine learning & AI algorithms.

Current algorithms include:

### dna-compare

Uses dynamic programming with a 2d array to quickly compute the longest common substring of two DNA sequences for comparison purposes.

More to come soon...
